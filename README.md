# WeatherWise

This project showcases an end-to-end IoT solution combining edge AI, cloud databases, and modern app development. 
An ESP32-S3 runs a local AI model to process sensor data (e.g., gas, motion, or environment) and sends the insights to Firebase in real time. 
A custom FlutterFlow app fetches and displays this data, providing remote monitoring and control.
